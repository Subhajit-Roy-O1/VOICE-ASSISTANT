It provides a range of functionalities, including translation, web search, YouTube video search, jokes, time and date information, and Wikipedia searches. The assistant can understand and respond in multiple languages.

I have used several libraries and APIs to implement the functionalities of my voice assistant. Here's a list of the libraries and APIs that are utilized in my project:

Googletrans (Translation): The googletrans library is used for language translation.

Playsound: The playsound library is used to play audio files.

gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech): The gTTS library is used to convert text to speech for the assistant's responses.

os: The os module is used for interacting with the operating system, such as file manipulation and removal.

pytube (YouTube): The pytube library is used for downloading YouTube videos.

pywhatkit (Web Search and YouTube Search): The pywhatkit library is used for performing web and YouTube searches.

SpeechRecognition: The SpeechRecognition library is used for speech recognition, allowing the assistant to understand voice commands.
